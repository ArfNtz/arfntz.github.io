<p>Hello, I am Biscott, the pedagogical assistant, for which it is easy to write interactive lessons, the medical assistant for which it is easy to program diagnostics, the cooking or training coach for which it is easy to write training sessions of recipes &hellip;</p>
<p>The idea of this app started with a quote by Alex Beard from this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/alex_beard_natural_born_learners">international conference about pedagogy</a> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We are natural learners&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alex Beard mentions PISA <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> results from multiple countries, in multiple contexts.
He supports the idea that : <code>creating individually personnalised conditions makes learning easier</code>.
The best progression is naturally reached by someone who&rsquo;s choosing his subjects and timetable.
In this context, how can a digital assistant help  ?</p>
<p>Of course nothing replaces direct human interaction between a teacher and a learner.
As a complementary tool, the digital assistant <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> allow a teacher to create individual learning conditions, by giving his pedagogical artifacts <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> the strength of an individual / interactive dialog to each leaner. The teacher designs / writes an artifact. The assistant helps to setup an interactive session, in the scope of a prepared activity, and for a large number of students.</p>
<p>For Biscott, pedagogical artifacts are called <code>activities</code>.</p>
<p>About <strong>accessibility</strong>, in case of sight problems, Biscott has the advantage to be used eyes closed, simply by listing and answering. This approach explains some features like <code>speak slower / faster</code> or <code>repeat</code> that are implemented /available for all activities.</p>
<p>Here is what the application looks like :</p>
<p><figure class="figure">
    <a href="/images/biscott_dialog_light.png" class="d-block" data-toggle="lightbox" data-gallery="post-gallery">

</p>
<p>To start and try Biscott, there are 3 steps :</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the application from the AppStore : <a href="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/biscott/id1547089565?l=fr"><img src="/images/AppStore.png" alt="AppStore"></a></li>
<li>Clic on this activity <code>exemple</code> for Biscott to start : <a href="/exemple.bsct"><img src="/images/biscott_56.png" alt="Activité Exemple"></a></li>
<li>Discover, reading further down, how to write an activity :</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-write-an-activity-">How to write an activity ?</h1>
<p>You only need a text editor. For instance, under <code>MacOS</code>, launch <code>TextEdit</code>.</p>
<p><strong>From a writer&rsquo;s point of view, the idea is to give to the reader many alternatives to explore.
His decisions will shape his experience : experiential learning, the best way to learn ;)</strong></p>
<p>From a technical point of view, writing an activity starts as follows :</p>
<pre><code class="language-md"># Title of my activity
:discipline:Art
A short description of my activity
Suitable for age 6-99 yo
</code></pre>
<p>The sharp <code>#</code> character starts an activity, followed by its title <code>Title of my activity</code>.
Biscott recognizes the mark <code>:discipline:</code> to classify the activity, in our case as <code>Art</code>.
After this first line, a free text describes the activity. One can for instance mention the targeted audience, minimum age, etc.
Next, we can add some steps to the activity, as follows :</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">## Step1
Here we start, once upon a time ...
...
Do you choose this or that ? 
</code></pre>
<p>The double sharp <code>##</code> mark starts a new step, followed by its unique name, in one word.
A free text follows, it&rsquo;s the content of the step that will be displayed and read by the Biscott assistant.
In this text it is possible to insert images and links, as follow :</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">## Step2
Ok, here is a picture for that : ![my pic title](myPic.jpg)
...
To browse the web site 'blabla' here is a link : [my link title](http://my.link.com)
</code></pre>
<p>The part surrounded by square brackets [] will be displayed as a link label.
The part surrounded by curly brackets {} is the file name or internet address.
To differentiate an image from a link, the image starts with an exclamation mark !.</p>
<p><strong>Where do we put the text file and the images ?</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the root of a folder named after activity, hence, in our example, in a folder named <code>exemple</code>.
The text filename is also named like the activity, with the extension <code>md</code> : <code>exemple.md</code>.
All the images are placed in the folder, at its root (no sub folder)
There must be at least on image, named after the activity, with <code>png</code> extension : <code>exemple.png</code>.
This image will be used to present the activity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Writing an activity is a fun an creative process, trying
to imagine the reader&rsquo;s reactions and define possible alternatives.</strong></p>
<h2 id="writing-alternatives">Writing alternatives</h2>
<p>Here is a complete activity, with alternatives.

<p>To reach the step <code>cuisine</code> the speaker / reader can use the verbs  <code>eat</code>,<code>cook</code>, or the word <code>cake</code> in his sentence, which also has to contain the word <code>cake</code> or <code>banana</code>.

<p>The iOS device will automatically launch Biscott when a <code>.bsct</code> file is received via <code>AirDrop</code> or opened from a mail.</p>
<p>Biscott analyses the steps and eventually displays anomalies. If everything is fine the activity starts.</p>
<p>During the activity it is possible to say <code>activate the analysis mode</code> to display step detection informations. This is used to refine the activity.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-edit-my-activity-on-the-ios-device-">Can I edit my activity on the iOS device ?</h2>
<p>Yes. The application shares its files.</p>
<p>Hence it is possible to use iOS&rsquo;s file manager and your favorite application to edit the text and the images of an activity.</p>
<p>Here is a screen shot of the activity <code>exemple</code> that we created, as seen in the file manager app on iPad :</p>
